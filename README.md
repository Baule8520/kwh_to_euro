# KWH to Euro Converter

Python Script that I use for Grafana to convert my kWh consumption in Euro €.

Fetches data from InfluxDB, converts it to € and stores is back to InfluxDB.

Quick & very dirty. Not production ready!

### Update 04.2023:

I added a option to calculate kwh & € for Shelly 3EM Pro.
